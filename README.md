# Spotify-Clone
I've created a fully functional Spotify clone with a sleek, modern design that closely resembles the original Spotify interface. Here's what's included:

#Key Features

Dark-themed UI with Spotify's signature green accent color

Fully functional music player with play/pause, skip, volume controls

Library management with playlists and liked songs

Browse and search functionality

Artist and album pages

Responsive design that works on all screen sizes

#How to Use

Navigate through the app using the sidebar

Browse featured playlists on the home page

Search for songs, artists, or albums

Create and manage your own playlists

Play music with the player controls at the bottom

The app uses localStorage to save your playlists and recently played tracks, so your data will persist between sessions. All music data is simulated for demonstration purposes.
